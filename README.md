# Interstellar-watch

## Description

This webpage was the result of becoming insprired from watching the movie Interstellar. I decided to replicate the transfer of information from the tesseract to the watch using morse code using javascript and had a blast learning to do it. Every second that passes after you open the webpage, the hand will move an X amount of time relative to the time on your operating system and will start printing dash or dot to the console just in case you dont catch the drift in the page.

This isn't my first time tackling with morse code so I didn't have trouble with that part.
